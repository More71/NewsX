                PayPal enables transfer of digital currencies to external wallets
            </h2>
            <p>
                <br> The move comes after nearly two years since PayPal enabled users to buy and sell crypto on its platform. <br>        
                <br>After rolling out the ability to buy and sell crypto on its platform in October 2020, PayPal is finally allowing users the ability to natively transfer, send and receive digital assets between PayPal and other wallets and exchanges.
                <br><br> As of Tuesday, the feature is available to select U.S. users, with the feature expanding to all eligible U.S.

                <br><br><strong>BTC</strong> $16,704, <strong>ETH</strong> $1,217, <strong>BSH</strong> $100, and <strong>LTC</strong> $74.58.  
                <br><br>Users would simply need to log in to their accounts and enter the crypto section of the application to start transferring coins. Users are generally required to complete a one-time ID verification before the procedure.In addition, customers who transfer their crypto onto PayPal can spend it via Checkout at millions of merchant terminals. The company has been granted a full Bitlicense by the New York Department of Financial Services for the conduct.
                <br><br>Crypto transfers to recipients outside of PayPal would incur a network fee based on their respective blockchains, but transfers between PayPal users will not incur such fees. To protect users' privacy, the firm generates a new recipient address for each transaction into one's PayPal account. PayPal will also not charge fees for incoming transfers,
                <br><br>The company is also working to integrate other forms of cryptocurrency services, such as central bank digital currencies, to boost its digital footprint. It is also exploring the possibility of launching its own stablecoin, dubbed "PayPal Coin." The discovery came after a developer found evidence of such a stablecoin within the source code of the company's iPhone app.

                Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's new bill also includes an incentive for those declaring crypto for tax purposes
            </h2>
            <p>
                <br> Crypto traders in Italy will be subject to a 26% capital-gains tax starting in 2023, according to a new budget that won parliamentary approval on Thursday. <br>        
                <br>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's 2023 expansionary budget – which was completed in a rush before the end of the year

                    – features 21 billion euros ($22.3 billion) in tax breaks to assist businesses and households facing the energy crisis, Reuters reported.
                    <br><br>Italy's (and most recently Portugal's) move to introduce a capital-gains tax on crypto comes ahead of the implementation of the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation that promises a licensing frameworks and stringent operating requirements for crypto-service providers in the 27-member bloc.
                    <br><br>The 26% rate applies to gains from crypto trading if they exceed 2,000 euros per tax period. As an incentive for declaring crypto profits, the new bill also sets a "substitute income tax" for investors at 14% of the value of the assets held as of Jan. 1, 2023, instead of the cost at the time of purchase.
                    <br><br>According to the new rules, losses from crypto investments can be deducted from profits and be carried forward.
                    <br><br>Investors, however, may require some additional guidance on what qualifies as a taxable event as the document also says, "the exchange between crypto assets having same characteristics and functions," doesn't constitute a "fiscal case."

                <br>The self-described game theorist admitted his role in draining Mango Markets’ treasury shortly after the incident in mid-October, and may now be the first U.S. resident to face charges for his role in manipulating a decentralized-finance trading platform.
